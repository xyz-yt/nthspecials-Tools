Hello everyone :)
These are my open source Tools for everyone to use
IMPORTANT!
If you want to use one of the python tools, you need to: 
1. install python (3.10 +)
2. Download the "requirements.txt" file from the repository
3. Open a cmd window where your "requirements.txt" file is stored (you do that with rightclick and clicking "open in command prompt")
4. Execute the command: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
5. Just open your Tool and Have Fun :)
